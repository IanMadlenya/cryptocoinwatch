## ToolTip

Hovering mouse over the icon shows you the tooltip:

Mode 1: The current price, 24-hour change and the total value for each coin that you have in your transaction list.
- `COIN: U$<price> (<24HourChange>%) = U$<total>`

Mode 2: The coin change over the last 24 hours, how much did you pay and what's worth now, profit or loss.
- `Coin change: <24HourChangeAvg>%`
- `Paid/Current: U$ <amountPaid> = U$ <currentValue>`:
- `Profit/Loss: U$<profit> (<profit>%)`

Change modes by left-clicking it.

_Double-click opens cryptocompare or the web-site designated in the settings._
