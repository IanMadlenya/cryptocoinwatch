## ToolTip

Hovering mouse over the icon shows you the tooltip:

Mode 1: The current price, 24-hour change and the total value for each coin that you have in your transaction list.
- `COIN: U$<price> (<24HourChange>%) = U$<total>`

Mode 2: How much did you pay and what's worth now.
- `Profit/Loss: U$<currentValue> - U$<amountPaid> = U$<profit> (<profitLoss>%)`:

Change modes by left-clicking it.

_Double-click opens cryptocompare or the web-site designated in the settings._
